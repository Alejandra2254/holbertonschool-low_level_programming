# Linked List

A linked list is one of the fundamental data structures, and it can be used to implement other data structures. It consists of a sequence of nodes, in which arbitrary data fields and one or two references, links, or pointers to the previous or next node are stored. The main benefit of linked lists with respect to conventional vectors is that the order of the linked elements can be different from the order of storage in memory or disk, allowing the order of movement of the list to be different from that of storage.
