`simple_shell` is a project that consists of building a simple Unix shell replica, in order to obtain a deeper appreciation of how it works.

our simple shell will have the ability to:
1. Initialize: when executing our program, it remains in an infinite loop that prints a prompt and is always ready to take any command.
2. Interpret: Simple_shell then reads the commands from stdin and executes them.
3. Terminate - After your commands run, simple_shell executes shutdown commands, frees memory, and terminates.
