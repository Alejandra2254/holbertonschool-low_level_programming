GENERAL
## What is a search algorithm

A search algorithm is an algorithm (typically involving a multitude of other, more specific algorithms [1]) which solves a search problem. Search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, either with discrete or continuous values.

## What is a linear search

Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.

## What is a binary search

binary search, also known as half-interval search,logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.

## What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

The appropriate search algorithm often depends on the data structure being searched, and may also include prior knowledge about the data. Some database structures are specially constructed to make search algorithms faster or more efficient, such as a search tree, hash map, or a database index.
