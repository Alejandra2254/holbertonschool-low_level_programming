# 0x1A. C - Hash tables

A hash table is widely used in computer science issues, it is used in many algorithms in which a search of a large amount of data has to be done.

It is an associative data structure that relates a key and a value using a hash function. The hash function is used to calculate the index to which the elements to be stored in the table will go.

The data table stores elements in what is known as slots or buckets, it can have an arbitrary number of these, it is the task of the hash function to define which slot each element to save should go to.

The hash function is the most important part of the hash table because it is the one that determines indices, which must be uniform "balancing the hash table" and that balance is used to find an element is constant.
