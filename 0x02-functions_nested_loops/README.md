# Function, nested loops
## A nested loop is a loop within a loop, an inner loop within the body of an outer one. Then the second pass of the outer loop triggers the inner loop again. ... This repeats until the outer loop finishes. Of course, a break within either the inner or outer loop would interrupt this process.
